Smart Shop assistant. Built for Firefox OS smart phone. It supports all standard HTML5 browsers.
As we are living increasingly busy lives, sometimes it's hard to find a product in a retail shop when we’re in a rush. We end up spending a lot of time searching for  products in a shop, especially if the shop layout is unknown. This application allows visitor to find a product easily in a shop if the shop has the functionality.

The idea is when the user enters into the shop, using location API, and if the shop supports the functionality, users will be asked if they need any assistance. If the user says yes, the app will show a list of products that can be searched. Once the user selects a product it will show him/her the location of that product. This application will also inform the user if there are any special offers related to the product they have chosen. e.g. 50% off or buy 3 for 2.

This application will also allow users to see all special offers and an FAQ page. This application will also allow the customer to pay with a PayPal account if the shop supports PayPal.

This application is not only suitable for large retail shops but also for local shops. If the shop doesn't have the product layout in a database, the user can ask questions directly through the application and that can be answered by the shop owner – similar to a virtual custom service chat session.
