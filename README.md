Smart Shop assistant. Build for Firefox OS mobile phone. It supports all standard HTML5 browsers.

As we are living very busy life and sometimes it's hard to find a product in a retail shop. We end up spending a lot of time finding product specially if the shop layout is unknown. This application allows visitor to find a product easily in a shop if the shop has the functionality.

The idea is when the user enters into the shop using location API and if the shop supports the functionality user will be asked if they need any assistant. If the user says yes, It will show a list of products that can be searched. Once the user select a product it will show him/her the location of that product. This application will also give if there's any special offer related to that product. e.g. 50% off or buy 3 for 2.

This application will also allow users to see all the special offer and a FAQ page. This application will also allow the customer to pay with Paypal account if the shop setup the Paypal details for customers.

This application is not only suitable for large retail shop but also for local shops. If the shop doesn't have the product layout in a database user can ask questions directly through the application and that can be answered by the shop owner.
